# parallel-structure

Glued-together bash script for running parallel runs "Structure" for population genetics inference for different values of `K` and reps.

You will need both `parallel` and structure installed â€” an easy task with conda:

```
conda install -c bioconda parallel structure
```

## Example

To check if the script works, please use the included example data set (borrowed from the structure website)

Please run the following command from the script directory:

```
bash parallel-structure.sh example-data/mainparams example-data/extraparams example-data/testdata1 output_dir 1 3 5 8
```

In the last four digits of the above command you are able to set, in the following order: minimum K, maximum K, number of repetitions and number of parallel jobs. 

The command starts 8 parallel jobs for K=1 to K=3 with 5 replicates for each tested value K.

All  output is saved to `output_dir/`
